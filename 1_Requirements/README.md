 # Description
## Basic Calculator
Basic Calculator is a project which can help the user to do simple maths calculations like Addition, Subtraction ,Multiplication ,division , Factorial, Power ,modulas,Finding Cube in faster and  accurate manner.
So in this project the input has to be in a form "Number1 (Operator) Number2". For example (5+6).In some example the input can be just single integer value example in case of factorial and cube. In this Project i am adding Extra operations like Calculating Cube,Factorial,modulus of the Number which will save the time of user while performing large calculations.
##  What is the purpose of a basic calculator?
* A basic calculator is sometimes referred to as a 4-function calculator. It's able to do simple arithmetic operations, which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use a basic calculator at home to figure out your monthly budget.

# SWOT
## STRENGTHS
* The  strength of this Calculator is its user-friendly nature and long lasting etc..
## WEAKNESSES
* Do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.
## OPPORTUNITIES
* The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than othe
## THREATS
* The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
